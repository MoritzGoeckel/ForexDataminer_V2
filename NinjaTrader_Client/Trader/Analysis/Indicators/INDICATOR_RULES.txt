1. Every indicator value must be normalized with the asset price. In that way it 
	stays comparable between different assets. (Best practice: Devide it through the price in the end)

2. Every indicator has to be either between 0 and 1 or between -1 and 1. Exceptions are possible but should be avoided.

3. Use the "mid" value or the getAvg() function on the tickdata. "last" and getLast() are deprecated. 

4. Every parameter has to be represented in the ID of the indicator, so it should be returned on "getName()"
