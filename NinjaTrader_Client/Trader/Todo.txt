//Implementing
	
Indicators: MACD RSI
Volume on price -> Always tends to go to the most vol (uphill)
NN for graphical structure of graph to outcome
Regression price (last couble of hours) to outcome

Update the Indicator Generator

//Datamining

--> #1 Find indicators with statistical correlations to the outcome
#2 Combine them with machinelearning
#3 Create a strategy
#4 Create a executen strategy

//Testing

#5 Backtest
#6 Papertrade
#7 Livetrade

//Create some unittests, cover the parts that are hard to test

//On hold
Maybe the data is garbage ;D
Refactor inRamDatamining, its too big
(Hm... architecture change?) Handle Data like SSI in Streamingdb, just use an indicator?
MachineLearning: Implement RandomForest (: MulitClasificationBase)
Posibility to recompute range etc (why?) (Infohandling)
Implement Indicator idea: Regression time to price -> Prediction = TradeMiner Indicator -> Periods with good profitibilty in the past (example: every monday from 10:30am - 11:45am)
