//Implementing

	Dividing the data in training- and validation- data (80% / 20%)
	IMachineLearning: (implement svm)

	Refactor inRamDatamining, its too big

	Implement Idicator idea: Regression time to price -> Prediction
	Implement Indicator idea: Regression price to outcome -> Prediction

(Hm... architecture change?) Handle Data like SSI in Streamingdb

Get predictive power for given indicator (Outcome / OutcomeCode) (Code first)
	--> Work over the Infohandling for Indicators

Indicators: MACD RSI 
Derived Indicators: 
	MA-Crossover, 
	STOCH-Crossover/Border, 
	Volume on price -> Always tends to go to the most vol (uphill)

Advanced Neural Network: Do we need to double convert data? :(

Trying out indicators with GetPredictivePower (Random / Genetic)
	Write to File, Delete from db again

//Datamining

--> #1 Find indicators with statistical correlations to the outcome
#2 Combine them with machinelearning
#3 Create a strategy
#4 Create a executen strategy

//Testing

#5 Backtest
#6 Papertrade
#7 Livetrade
