//Implementing
	
	Indicators: Volume on price -> Always tends to go to the most vol (uphill)
				NN for graphical structure of graph to outcome
				Regression price (last couble of hours) to outcome
				Regression time to price -> Prediction = TradeMiner Indicator -> Periods with good profitibilty in the past (example: every monday from 10:30am - 11:45am)				

	Maybe the data is garbage ;D

Run and debug!

//Datamining

--> #1 Find indicators with statistical correlations to the outcome
#2 Combine them with machinelearning
#3 Create a strategy
#4 Create a executen strategy

//Testing

#5 Backtest
#6 Papertrade
#7 Livetrade

//Create some unittests, cover the parts that are hard to test

//On hold
ML: RandomForest (: MulitClasificationBase), Naive Bayes, SVM classification (too unprobabilistic), SVM regression (unprobabilistic), 
Refactor inRamDatamining, its too big
(Hm... architecture change?) Handle Data like SSI in Streamingdb, just use an indicator?
Posibility to recompute range etc (why?) (Infohandling)
