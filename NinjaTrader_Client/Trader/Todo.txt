//Implementing

	Refactor inRamDatamining, its too big
	(Hm... architecture change?) Handle Data like SSI in Streamingdb

	MachineLearning: Implement RandomForest (: MulitClasificationBase)

	Indicators: MACD RSI NN-Timeseries+(Outcome)
	Derived Indicators: 
		MA-Crossover, 
		STOCH-Crossover/Border, 
		Volume on price -> Always tends to go to the most vol (uphill)
	Implement Indicator idea: Regression time to price -> Prediction
	Implement Indicator idea: Regression price to outcome -> Prediction
	Implement Indicator idear: NN for graphical structure of graph to outcome

Get predictive power for given indicator (Outcome / OutcomeCode) (Code first)
	--> Infohandling
		-->Posibility to recompute
		-->save the cheap info

	-->LogisticRegression Indicator>Outcome_codes(multiple) -> Get Error, the smaller the error, the more predPower

Trying out indicators with GetPredictivePower (Random / Genetic)
	Write to File, Delete from db again

//Datamining

--> #1 Find indicators with statistical correlations to the outcome
#2 Combine them with machinelearning
#3 Create a strategy
#4 Create a executen strategy

//Testing

#5 Backtest
#6 Papertrade
#7 Livetrade

//Create some unittests, cover the parts that are hard to test
