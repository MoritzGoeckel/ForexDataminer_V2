//Implementing

	Dividing the data in training- and validation- data (80% / 20%)
	IMachineLearning: (implement svm)

Advanced Neural Network: Do we need to double convert data? :(
	Refactor inRamDatamining, its too big

	Implement Idicator idea: Regression time to price -> Prediction
	Implement Indicator idea: Regression price to outcome -> Prediction

(Hm... architecture change?) Handle Data like SSI in Streamingdb
Getpredictive power for given indicator
Indicators: MACD MA STOCH RSI

//Datamining

--> #1 Find indicators with statistical correlations to the outcome
#2 Combine them with machinelearning
#3 Create a strategy
#4 Create a executen strategy

//Testing

#5 Backtest
#6 Papertrade
#7 Livetrade

//Legend
