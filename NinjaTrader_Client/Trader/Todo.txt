//Implementing
	
Indicators: MACD RSI
Derived Indicators: 
	MA-Crossover, 
	STOCH-Crossover/Border, 
	Volume on price -> Always tends to go to the most vol (uphill)
	NN for graphical structure of graph to outcome
	Regression price (last couble of hours) to outcome

//Datamining

--> #1 Find indicators with statistical correlations to the outcome
#2 Combine them with machinelearning
#3 Create a strategy
#4 Create a executen strategy

//Testing

#5 Backtest
#6 Papertrade
#7 Livetrade

//Create some unittests, cover the parts that are hard to test

//On hold
Refactor inRamDatamining, its too big
(Hm... architecture change?) Handle Data like SSI in Streamingdb
MachineLearning: Implement RandomForest (: MulitClasificationBase)
Implement Indicator idea: Regression time to price -> Prediction
Posibility to recompute range etc (why?) (Infohandling)
