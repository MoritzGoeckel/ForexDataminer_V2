//Implementing

	Dividing the data in training- and validation- data (80% / 20%)
	IMachineLearning: (implement svm)

DataminingForm: Creating input dialogs for a fast datamining workflow

	Advanced Neural Network: Do we need to double convert data? :(
	Refactor inramdatamining, its too big

	Implement Idicator idea: Regression time to price -> Prediction
	Implement Indicator idea: Regression price to outcome -> Prediction

(Hm... architecture change?) Handle Data like SSI in Streamingdb

Create migrationscript for database

//Datamining

Find indicators with statistical correlations to the outcome
Combine them with machinelearning
Create a strategy
Create a executen strategy

//Testing

Backtest
Papertrade
Livetrade
